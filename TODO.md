- Update the unit tests for codewriter writeArithmetic now that I changed the mechanism for converting between text and integer representations.
- Add tests for codewriter writePushPop. It compiles, but probably has errors.
- The reference VM implementation does not appear to compile to .asm, so find a different way to run automated integ tests.
